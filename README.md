# wallpaper_app

 Project Overview

Wallpaper Studio is a modern, responsive application built with Flutter to showcase curated digital wallpapers. The core feature is its fully adaptive UI that adjusts the layout based on screen size (desktop, tablet, and mobile).

 Setup and Installation
This is a Flutter project. You will need the Flutter SDK (version 3.x+) installed to run the application.

Prerequisites: Ensure Flutter is installed and configured correctly.
File Structure: The application code is conceptually split into five files (main.dart, home_screen.dart, category_details_screen.dart, common_widgets.dart, and data_models.dart) within the lib/ directory.

Run the App (Web Recommended):
flutter build windows

How to Test:
Start the app and navigate to the Home screen. Observe the number of category columns.
Click a category to enter the Details screen. Observe the layout of the Wallpaper Grid next to the Phone Preview.
Resize the browser window slowly: Watch how the grid columns change (3 -> 2 -> 1) and how the Details screen switches from a side-by-side row to a stacked column when the width drops below 1000px and 600px, respectively.
